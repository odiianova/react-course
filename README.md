# react-course
Projects, exercises, and resources from Maximilian Schwarzmüller's 'React - The Complete Guide' course (https://acad.link/reactjs). Join me on my journey as I explore React fundamentals and deepen my comprehension of modern web development with React.js.

The code snapshots are structured into separate branches, with each branch dedicated to a specific project.
